Current Project: Wildfire Prediction

I used UNET++ (a neural network architecture often used for biomedical image segmentation) along with the Seasfire Cube dataset to make a Wildfire Prediction Application.
Yellow means a higher probability of that pixel being the predicted class, and blue means a lower probability.

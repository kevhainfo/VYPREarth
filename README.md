# VYPREarth

We have the Dataset(DATASET)

The VYPR Club's PlanetEarth Project Repository
Current Project: Wildfire Prediction

How The Dev Process works
1. We talk about what changes we want to make
2. When you want to make a change, when you commit a file, make a new branch
3. Then we can merge the files into the main respository

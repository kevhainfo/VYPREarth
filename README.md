# VYPREarth

The VYPR Club's PlanetEarth Project Repository
Current Project: Wildfire Prediction

We're using UNET++ with the Seasfire Cube to make a Wildfire Prediction Application

How This Works
1. We talk about what changes we want to make
2. When you want to make a change, when you commit a file, make a new branch
3. Then we can merge the files into the main respository
